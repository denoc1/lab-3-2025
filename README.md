# Assignment: Movie Times

## Goal
Practice working with:
- `String`, `int`, and `double` variables
- assignment and arithmetic operators
- casting between `int` and `double`
- rounding numbers

---

## Task
Write a Java program that converts a movie length from minutes into hours and minutes.  
Your program should:

1. Create & intialize a variable to hold the **movie name**.
2. Create & initialize a variable to hold the **movie length in minutes** (an `int`).  
   
     
3. Calculate:
   - The number of hours and the number of minutes for the movie.
   - The total length of the movie in **decimal hours** (using casting).  
   - The decimal hours should be rounded to **two decimal places**.  
    
4. Print the result in this exact format:

## Example
If the movie is *Inception* and the movie time is 148 minutes:

"Inception" is 2 hours and 28 minutes long (2.47 hours total). Enjoy the show!

## Notes
- Be sure to put your program header at the top of your code.
- Be sure to  use comments if you are using a complicated process that should be explained to the reader.
- Be sure to use the correct variable types (`String`, `int`, `double`).  
- You should be using both integer division and modulus.  
- You should use casting between types at some point.
- Be sure the movie name is in quotes.
